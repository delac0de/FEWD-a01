![The Greatest Singer In The World](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/12/19/17/22461370-7810971-Statement_shoes_Celine_Dion_s_fans_tell_her_you_ve_got_chickens_-m-37_1576778325876.jpg)

I lowkey (and *not* so lowkey) **love** Celine Dion.  This love goes way back to the 90s.  I'm currently trying to figure out how much I love her and if it's enough love to want to pay that much love money towards seeing her in concert in March.  Anyway, this photo cracks me up everytime I stare at it.  The heels.  The pose.  It's everything.  Battling Celine's "Courage" for current ownership of my earholes are Doja Cat's "Juicy" and Kendrick Lamar's "Blow My High" - complete different wavelengths. 

What other tidbits?  I have to make an effort to not wear all black.  Love dogs but prefer cats.  Think people watching is the best.  And, sometimes I dabble in photography, which you can check out [@shotbyeliza](https://www.instagram.com/shotbyeliza/)

*Have a good day.  Enjoy your burrito.*
